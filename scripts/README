To create plots run the script
	create_plots.sh

The script takes two arguments
	- Path to benchmark files generated by the framework 
	- Machine name after which the plots are named

The script will generated some intermediate files in the current director
which are named like rt_c#num_clients and tp_c#num_clients. Currently the
script only generates plots for 1-4 clients
