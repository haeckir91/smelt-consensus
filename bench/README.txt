There are two executables:
-start_bench
-start_bench_libsync

The executable start_bench does not use the trees generated by libsync,
where as at the moment start_bench_libsync uses them for onepaxos.
The arguments to the executables are:
- Protocol on Tier1
- Protocol on Tier2
- Path to config file

The Protocols are encoded in the following way
-1Paxos = 0
-TPC = 1
-BROAD = 2
-CHAIN = 3
-SHM = 4
-NONE = 5
Only certain combinations work at the moment (TODO)
1Paxos/SHM
TPC/SHM
BROAD/SHM
CHAIN/SHM
1Paxos/NONE
TPC/NONE
BROAD/NONE
CHAIN/NONE

The config file has the following format: 
18 #num_cpu
4 #num_replicas
4 #node_size
2 #num_clients
0 1 2 3  #node0 cores
4 5 6 7  #node1 cores
8 9 10 11 #node2 cores
12 13 14 15 #node3 cores
16 17     #client_cores

If only the Tier1 protocol is started the node_size hast to be 1 i.e.
12 #num_cpu
10 #num_replicas
1 #node_size
2 #num_clients
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  #node0 cores
10 11    #client_cores
